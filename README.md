# SaYo Pillow Machine Learning Project


#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
Smart-Yoga Pillow (SaYopillow) is a Smart Pillow connected to a wireless tracker to monitor sleeping habits and features to determine stress levels.
The purpose of this project is to determine if those sleeping features can be used to predict a person's snoring rate and reduce it if necessary.
Another purpose of this project is to simplify the stress level categories to detect early stages of being over stressed
from a numerical scale (0 to 4 where 3 to 4 are signs of high strss levels) to a categorical scale (not stressed, stressed, over stressed).

### Methods Used
* Multi-Linear Regression Modeling for Predictive Modeling
* Feature Correlation Selection
* K-Means Clustering 
* Elbow Method
* Data Visualizations (Correlation Matrix & Elbow Plot)

### Technologies 
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook


## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)
